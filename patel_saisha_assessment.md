## Question-Specific Feedback

### Code Tracing Questions [30/30]

#### Question 1: Loop Tracing
- **Performance:** Correct output (no output) with accurate explanation
- **Strengths:** Showed detailed work calculations tracking val through each iteration (550, 605, 665, 731, 804); correctly concluded val never reaches 2000
- **Points Earned:** 10/10

#### Question 2: Sequence Filtering
- **Performance:** Correct output (7) with clear explanation
- **Strengths:** Identified filtering logic; showed work with checkmarks for numbers â‰¥ 5; accurately calculated counter (4), total (28), and result (7)
- **Points Earned:** 10/10

#### Question 5: String Pattern Matching
- **Performance:** Correct output (5) with thorough explanation
- **Strengths:** Clearly explained the loop logic; correctly identified XY and XX pair detection; accurate accumulation (2 + 2 + 1 = 5)
- **Points Earned:** 10/10

### Code Writing Questions [48/50]

#### Question 3: Checkerboard Pattern
- **Logic:** Nested loop with modulo conditional for alternating pattern
- **Strengths:**
  - Correct nested loop structure (for i in range(n), for j in range(n))
  - Modulo logic: `if i + j % 2 == 0` produces alternating pattern
  - Proper print with end parameter for spacing
  - Correct newline handling with print()
- **Issues:** Missing spaces between characters (requirement states "Include spaces between characters")
- **Points Earned:** 23/25

#### Question 4: Input Validation Loop
- **Logic:** While loop with input handling, break/continue structure
- **Strengths:**
  - While True with break condition for -999
  - Validation range checking (< 10 or > 100)
  - Correct use of continue to skip invalid entries
  - Sum and count accumulation logic
  - Proper output of both values
- **Points Earned:** 25/25

#### Question 6: Number Pattern Display
- **Status:** Not attempted (only "--" provided)
- **Points Earned:** 0/25

#### Question 7: Threshold Counting
- **Status:** Not attempted (only "--" provided)
- **Points Earned:** 0/25

## Performance Summary

Your code tracing is exceptional. All three required questions show perfect understanding with detailed work shown, demonstrating strong analytical and logical reasoning skills. You clearly track variables through complex iterations and explain program flow with precision.

Your code writing in SET A is excellent. Q4 demonstrates complete mastery of while loops, input validation, and control flow. Q3 shows strong understanding of nested loops and conditional logic, with the only minor issue being spacing formatting.

Q6 and Q7 were not attempted. Completing these would have resulted in a perfect 80/80 score, as your demonstrated competency across all attempted questions is outstanding.
